### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Paolo Espinoza, I am a profoundly motivatated data-driven business analyst, with the capacity to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies and business environments. I characterize myself as a problem solver that emphasizes massively in critical thinking. With a work and educational background in Finance and skills in Python, Pandas, Excel, both SQL (AWS) and NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB), Machine Learning predictive models (times-series forecasting), and data visualisation tools such as JavaScript, Tableau, Plotly, and Power BI from University of Miami's data vizualization bootcamp.
I find profound joy in understanding and extracting insights from data that enables my organization and I to make informed data-driven decisions thus reaching common and organizational goals.
